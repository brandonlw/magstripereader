# Magnetic Stripe Reader Redux

Android Magnetic Stripe Reader

This is a simple Android (Java) project to read Track 2 magnetic stripe data from the audio (mic) jack of a mobile device and display it to the screen. You can build your own reader to use with this, or you can use the old Square magnetic stripe readers that plug right into the headphone/mic jack on most mobile devices.

It supports swipes in both directions, and displays partial results of any incomplete scans (for stubborn cards you just can't get to work 100%).
